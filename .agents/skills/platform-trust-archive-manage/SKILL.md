# Salesforce Archive

Operate Salesforce Archive (also called Trusted Services Archive) through its Connect API and the `ArchiveActivity` job-metadata object. This skill covers how to search and restore archived records, run the analyzer, handle RTBF erasure and PII masking, check storage, and — the part most often missed — how to read archive job status from `ArchiveActivity` and use a job's Id + Type to download its logs.

## Scope

- **In scope**: Calling the Archive Connect API operations under `/platform/data-resilience/archive/`; querying the `ArchiveActivity` object via SOQL/Connect; correlating a job's `ArchiveActivity` record with its log-download endpoints; the verify-after-write pattern for each async operation.
- **Out of scope**: Defining archive policies / `ArchivePolicyDefinition` metadata; building UI; generating Flows over archive data (`ArchiveActivity` is **not** Flow-queryable — see Gotchas); generic backup/export tooling unrelated to the add-on.

---

## Required Inputs

Gather or infer before acting:

- **Operation intent**: search (this is also how you view archived records), unarchive, analyze, mask, RTBF, storage check, or job-status/log lookup.
- **Target sObject** (`sobjectName`): required for search and unarchive.
- **Filters**: search and unarchive require `sobjectName` + at least one filter.
- **For log downloads**: the `requestId` (an `ArchiveActivity` Id, `8qv…` prefix) of a completed, log-producing job, and `reportType` = that activity's `Type`.

Preconditions (confirm or surface to the user if a call returns a not-permitted error):
- The **org** must have Salesforce Archive enabled. Every operation is gated on this first.
- Each operation requires a **specific user permission** on top of the org gate — see the Permissions table below. There is no single "archive admin" role; access is per-capability.

---

## Permissions

Every operation first requires the org to have Salesforce Archive enabled. On top of that org gate, each capability is gated by a distinct **user permission**. A call the user isn't permitted for fails with a "not permitted" error — match the error to the missing permission below.

| Operation | User permission required |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| `search-archived-records`, `get-search-archived-records-next-page` | `ViewSearchPage` (Archive Search) — **not** `ViewArchivedRecords` |
| `search-archived-records-with-sharing-rules` | `ViewArchivedRecords` |
| `unarchive-records` | `UnarchiveSdk` |
| `forget-archived-records` (RTBF) + `get-rtbf-status` | `Rtbf` |
| `mask-archived-records` + `get-masking-status` | `Rtbf` (masking shares the same `Rtbf` permission — **not** a separate entitlement) |
| `run-analyzer`, `get-analyzer-report`, `get-archive-storage-used` | `ArchiveAnalyzer` |
| `get-execution-details-stream-url`, `get-failed-records-stream-url` | `ViewActivitiesPage` (Archive Activities) |

---

## Workflow

All steps are sequential within a task. Read the referenced file the first time you touch that area.

1. **Identify the operation and read the contract** — do not rely on general knowledge of the Archive API, which has non-obvious contracts. Load `references/connect-api-operations.md` for the exact request/response shape, required inputs, and per-operation gotchas of every Archive Connect API operation. Do this before constructing any call (e.g. `dateRanges` plural vs singular, `isSuccess` flag vs HTTP status, `url: null` meaning no log).

2. **For job status / monitoring, read the data model** — when the task involves archive jobs, failures, progress, counts, or logs, load `references/archive-activity-entity.md` for the `ArchiveActivity` field reference and how it links to the Connect API. Query `ArchiveActivity` via SOQL or Connect — **not** Flow. For a worked end-to-end example (find failed/in-progress jobs, then pull their execution-detail and failed-records logs), load `examples/monitor-failed-jobs.md`.

3. **Construct and send the call** — every operation is a `{method, path, body}` REST call. Send it with whatever Connect/REST API tool your environment provides (an MCP server that invokes Connect/REST APIs, the `sf` CLI, or any REST client). Two path rules are critical (full per-operation contracts are in `references/connect-api-operations.md`):

   - **The operation names in this skill are NOT URL paths.** `search-archived-records`, `unarchive-records`, etc. are labels; never put them in the path. Use the short literal paths below (each relative to base `/platform/data-resilience/archive`). Sending the operation name as a path segment (e.g. `/…/archive/search-archived-records`) returns **404**.
   - **The path stops at `/platform/data-resilience/archive/…` — there is NO `/connect` segment**, even though this is a Connect API. A **404 / `NOT_FOUND` here means the path is wrong, NOT that Archive is disabled** — fix the path before concluding the add-on is missing.

   | Operation | Method + Path | Notes |
   |-----------|---------------|-------|
   | search-archived-records | `POST /search` | requires `sobjectName` + ≥1 filter |
   | search next page | `GET /search/next/{scrollId}` | stop when `scroll_id == "-1"` |
   | search with sharing rules | `POST /search/with-sharing-rules` | uses `filtersJson` object map |
   | unarchive-records | `POST /unarchive` | `sobjectName` + filters |
   | run-analyzer / report | `POST /analyzer/run` · `GET /analyzer/report` | |
   | forget / RTBF + status | `POST /rtbf` · `GET /rtbf/{requestId}` | |
   | mask + status | `POST /mask` · `GET /mask/{requestId}` | |
   | storage used | `GET /storage/archive-used` | |
   | execution-detail / failed-records log | `GET /log/execution-details-stream-url` · `GET /log/failed-records-stream-url` | query params `requestId`, `reportType` |

   With the `sf` CLI, prefix the path with `/services/data/v67.0`; some MCP/REST tools take the bare path and add the version themselves (tool-dependent — see the reference). Then follow the contract: for searches, supply `sobjectName` + ≥1 filter; for date filtering use the plural `dateRanges` array of `{field, from, to}` with full ISO-8601 datetimes.

4. **Branch on the right signal** — some operations return HTTP 201 with a body-level success flag (`body.statusCode`, `body.isSuccess`). Read `references/connect-api-operations.md` for which signal to trust per operation; never assume the HTTP status alone means success.

5. **Verify after every write** — re-read state to confirm the effect (see the Verify-After-Write table below). Async operations (analyzer, RTBF, masking) return a request id you must poll.

---

## Verify-After-Write

| After this write | Confirm by |
|------------------|-----------|
| `run-analyzer` | Poll `get-analyzer-report` until the report is populated |
| `unarchive-records` | Re-run `search-archived-records` — confirm records left the archive |
| `forget-archived-records` (RTBF) | Poll `get-rtbf-status` with the returned `request_id` |
| `mask-archived-records` | Poll `get-masking-status` with the returned `request_id` |

---

## Rules / Constraints

| Constraint | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Search & unarchive require `sobjectName` + at least one filter | An unfiltered request is rejected with "Search must be based on at least 1 field" — a full-object operation is never allowed. |
| Date filters must be full ISO-8601 datetimes (`2020-01-01T00:00:00Z`) | A date-only value (`2020-01-01`) returns `400 JSON_PARSER_ERROR` because the field is typed `xsd:dateTime`. |
| Search uses `dateRanges` (plural array); unarchive uses `dateRange` (singular) | They are genuinely different fields on the two endpoints; using the wrong shape silently drops the filter or 400s. |
| Stop pagination when `scroll_id == "-1"` | Calling `get-search-archived-records-next-page` with `"-1"` returns 500. |
| Log downloads need a real `ArchiveActivity` Id as `requestId` + that activity's `Type` as `reportType` | The backend resolves the log by the activity record; a mismatched `reportType` returns no log. |
| Excluded objects are not retrievable | `Feed`, `History`, `Relation`, `Share` are not searchable; Files/Attachments are not retrievable via this API — do not promise them. |
| Query `ArchiveActivity` via SOQL/Connect, never Flow | `ArchiveActivity` has `isProcessEnabled=false`, so a Flow "Get Records" element on it fails with "You can't get ArchiveActivity records in a flow." |

---

## Gotchas

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Treating HTTP 201 as success | Several operations return 201 with a body-level outcome. Branch on `body.statusCode` (search) or `body.isSuccess` (`with-sharing-rules`), not the HTTP code. |
| `run-analyzer.isRunning` used as a signal | It is **always** `null`; the endpoint only populates `message`. Poll `get-analyzer-report` to confirm completion instead. |
| `search-archived-records-with-sharing-rules` filters as an array | `filtersJson` must be a JSON-encoded **object map** `{"Field":"Value"}`, not an array of `{field,value}`; the array form returns `isSuccess:false "No valid filters provided"`. |
| Log `url` treated as present because status is 201 | `get-*-stream-url` returns `{url}`; `url: null` means no log was resolved. Always check `url != null`. |
| Misreading `get-archive-storage-used` | `usedStorage[]`/`availableStorage[]` are parallel positional arrays: index 0=org DATA, 1=org FILE, 2=archive RECORDS, 3=archive FILE. `availableStorage[2]`/`[3]` are **always 0** (archive tier is unmetered) — that means "not tracked", not "full". |
| Expecting `ArchiveActivity` in a Flow | It is not Flow-enabled (`isProcessEnabled=false`). Use SOQL/Connect/Reports. |
| Hitting unarchive caps | Unarchive processes ≤1000 matched records per request and ≤50 requests/hour/org, and restores the whole archived hierarchy of each match. |
| RTBF/masking caps | `criteria` ≤10 entries (one per object); ≤10,000 root records/day (shared between RTBF and masking); masking is irreversible. Both RTBF and masking are gated by the same `Rtbf` user permission. |

---

## Output Expectations

This is a knowledge/API skill — it produces API calls and their interpreted results, plus SOQL against `ArchiveActivity`. It does not generate deployable metadata. Deliverables per task: the correct operation invocation(s), the right success-signal branching, and a verify-after-write confirmation.
